Have you ever thought to yourself, "It will take me a while to learn English." Well, you're not alone, Luckily, we are here to make things a little easier and faster for you. On this program, we take a sentence and break it down so that you can easily memorize it. So don't think, "It will take me a while to get used to this" because it is very simple. Just open your mind and let it go. We're going to start by breaking the sentence into two parts.


#### It will take me awhile to break in these new shoes.

So to make this sentence easier to understand, we're going to divide it into two. The first part, "It will take me awhile to" is expressing that it will take some time. It will not be a short time, but a somewhat longer time to finish a task. The second part, "break in these new shoes" means you become used to the new shoes. You know when you get a paire of shoes, especially high heels for all the ladies out there, they are often really tight. But once you wear them a few times, your feet become used to the shoses and they're more comfortable. This is called breaking them in. You can also **break in a baseball glove**. So when you first buy a baseball glove, the leather is quite <mark>stiff</mark>. But after a few times using the baseball glove, or after you have broken it it, it is more comfortable and easy to use. So putting these two parts together, "It will take me awhile to break in these new shoses" means that you are not comfortable in your shoes and it will take some time before you become comfortable. 

Now let's move on to memorizing this sentence.


##### Memorizing

`It will take me awhile to` `break in these new shoes`

##### Dialogue

* A: Are those new shoes?

B: It will take me awhile to break in these new shoes.

* A: Why are you <mark>limping</mark>?

B: It will take me awhile to break in these new shoes.

* A: Your feet must be aching like bad.

B: It will take me awhile to break in these new shoes.

Now let's go through three example sentences. I want you to repeat the sentence after me and then I will explain it. 

Let's start with sentence number one.

##### Example

* It will take me awhile to memorize this.

If you think that it will take a long time to remember something, you can use this expression. When you are trying to learn something new, then it can take some time. But luckily for you, because you are watching Full Sentence English, it will only take ten minutes! Then you can say, "It won't take me a long time to memorize this."

Let's move on to sentence number two.

* It will take me awhile to get used to the new house

To get used to sth is to become comfortable. you can get used to a new schdule, you can get used to living alone, you can get used to a new kind of music. But in this case, it is getting used to the new house. So you know when you first move, **you have to become adjusted to your new surroundings**. So if you say, "It will take me awhile to get used the new house", it means that it will be some time before you're fully comfortable with your new place.

Now it's time for sentence number three.

* It will take me awhile to get to work

This sentence means that is going to take some time to arrive at work. If you take a taxi during rush hour, then you can say, "It will take me awhile to get to work." Or if **you are considering** moving to an area that is far away from your work, that you can say, "It will take me awhile to get to work". There you have it.

Three example sentences that can help further your understanding.
Can you think of any other example sentences? Let's move on to part 2.

#### It will take me awhile to get there by bus

Now, this sentence can be easily understood if we break it into two parts. Part one, "It will take me awhile" means that is will take some time to do something. It won't take five minutes, it won't take ten minutes, but maybe a little longer time.

Part two, "get there by bus." This means that you will take the bus. Maybe you will consider different kinds of transportation like a taxi, or a bus, or a car, or a subway. But this part of the sentence is expressing that you will take the bus.

So if we put part 1 and part 2 together, then it is saying that
it will take some time to arrive there because you will take the bus. if you take the subway, it will probably be faster.

Maybe you would say this to somebody that you are going to meet. You want to **warn them** that it will take some time, so you can say, "It will take me awhile to get there by bus." Then the other person will know that you will not be there immediately.

So now le't move on to memorizing this expression.

##### Memorizing

Now it's time to run through two example sentences to help you futher understand this sentence.

Let's start off with sentence number one.

##### Example Sentence

* It will take me awhile to clean up this mess.

Have you ever looked around your apartment and thought that it will take a really long time to make it neat again? You have dishes to do, that floor is dirty, **laundry needs to be done**. Then you can use this sentence, "It will take me awhile to clean up this mess." That means that you will not have time to do much more because it may take you a couple of hours to clean. 

Now let's move on the the second sentence.


* It will take me awhile before I can submit the final report.

As we have learned, "it will take me awhile" means that it will take some time. You'll often hear this with, "It will take me awhile before." That means it will take me a bit of time to finish something. In this case, it is submitting the final report. To submit is to turn in, to give to someone in a higher position. You can submit an essay to your professor, you can submit a photograph to a contest, you can also submit a final report to your boss. 

Now it's time to wrap things up.
